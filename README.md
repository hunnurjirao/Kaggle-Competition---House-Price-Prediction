# Kaggle-Competition-House-Price-Prediction

This is a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) of predicting house price using Machine Learning Techniques.

In this project, I have used RandomForest Regression, to predict the house prices. You can find my kaggle notebook and datasets [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/khunnurjirao/house-price-pred-random-forest) 

Steps included in End-to-End Machine Learing Project:

* Load Datasets
* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Scaling
* Creating a Pipeline for Numeric and Categotical Valuse
* Train Model
* Fine Tune the Model
* Deploy the model
